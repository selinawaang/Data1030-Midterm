# Data1030 Final Project: Injury Prediction for Distance Running Athletes

## Project overview:

The goal of this project is to predict whether an athlete will get injured on a given day based on their recent training history. This is a classification problem with the target variable being a binary variable indicating injury or no injury. The motivation behind this project is that sports teams want to prevent injury of their athletes, so it will be useful to know which factors contribute to injury, and signal athletes to take precautions to prevent injury.

I trained 4 different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, SVC and KNN. The most predictive model is Logistic Regression, which gives a mean F_2 score of 0.506 (0.5 standard deviations avobe baseline).
